        <ul>
            <li>
                Logical address:
                It is the address generated by the CPU when the program is running. As it doesnâ€™t exist physically, it
                is also called a s virtual address. It can also be defined as the address space perceived to be physical
                address by the operating system. The set of all logical address generated is called logical address
                space.
            </li>
            <li>
                Physical Address:
                Identifies a physical location of required data in the main memory. The user never directly deals with
                the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the
                logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs
                physical memory for its execution. The corresponding physical address set generated by all logical
                address forms the physical address space.
                The logical address must be mapped to the physical address before its usage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Memory Management Unit:
                The MMU converts the logical address to its appropriate physical address.
            </li>
            <li>
                Page:
                The logical address space is divided into fixed length blocks called pages. Each process is thus divided
                into pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frames:
                The physical address space is divided into fixed length blocks called frames. The size of a page is
                always equal to the size of a frame.
            </li>
            <li>
                Paging:
                It is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main
                memory in the form of pages. In the Paging method, the main memory is divided into frames. The size of a
                frame should be kept the same as that of a page to have maximum utilization of the main memory and to
                avoid external fragmentation. Paging is used for faster access to data, and it is a logical concept.
                Some pages are stored in frames in the main memory while others are stored in the secondary memory in
                the form of frames.
            </li>
            <li>
                Page faults:
                A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual
                address space but not loaded in physical memory. Since actual physical memory is much smaller than
                virtual memory, page faults occur. In case of a page fault, OS might have to replace one of the existing
                pages (victim page) with the needed page. Different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways
                to decide which page is the victim page. The target for all algorithms is to reduce the number of page
                faults.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./img/1.png" class="m-5 mx-auto" style="width:30%">
        <h2>Page fault handling:</h2>
        <p>The following are the sequence of events that take place in the computer when a page fault occurs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The computer hardware traps to the kernel and program counter (PC) is saved on the stack. Current
                instruction state information is saved in CPU registers.
            </li>
            <li>
                An assembly program is started to save the general registers and other volatile information to keep the
                OS from destroying it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Operating system finds that a page fault has occurred and tries to find out which virtual page is
                needed. Sometimes hardware register contains this required information. If not, the operating system
                must retrieve PC, fetch instruction and find out what it was doing when the fault occurred.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once virtual address caused page fault is known, system checks to see if address is valid and checks if
                there is no protection access problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the virtual address is valid, the system checks to see if a page frame is free. If no frames are
                free, the page replacement algorithm is run to remove a page.
            </li>
            <li>
                If frame selected is dirty, page is scheduled for transfer to disk, context switch takes place, fault
                process is suspended and another process is made to run until disk transfer is completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                As soon as page frame is clean, operating system looks up disk address where needed page is, schedules
                disk operation to bring it in.
            </li>
            <li>
                When disk interrupt indicates page has arrived, page tables are updated to reflect its position, and
                frame marked as being in normal state.
            </li>
            <li>
                Faulting instruction is backed up to state it had when it began and PC is reset. Faulting is scheduled,
                operating system returns to routine that called it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assembly Routine reloads register and other state information, returns to user space to continue
                execution.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Algorithm:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of
                all
                pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be
                replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example:
                Consider the below table with five frames and requests as shown in figure. The pages which enter the
                frame list first become the victim page during a page fault/miss.
                Number of Page Faults = 9
                Number of hits = 6
            </li>
            <img src="./img/3.png" class="m-5 mx-auto" style="width:30%">
            <li>
                Beladyâ€™s Anomaly:
                Beladyâ€™s anomaly proves that it is possible to have more page faults when increasing the number of page
                frames while using the First in First Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm or any other non-stack-based
                algorithm. Consider the following FIFO algorithm example with three frames: -
                <br>
                <img src="./img/4.png" class="m-5 mx-auto" style="width:30%">
                <br>
                Number of page faults with three frames=9.
                Now consider the same example with four frames: -
                <br>
                <img src="./img/5.png" class="m-5 mx-auto" style="width:30%">
                <br>
                Number of page faults with four frames=10.
                The number of page faults increases even though the number of frames was increased. This is due to
                Beladyâ€™s anomaly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stack-based algorithm:
                A stack-based algorithm is one for which it can be shown that the set of pages in memory for N frames is
                always a subset of the set of pages that would be in memory with N+1 frames. FIFO is a non-stack-based
                algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Advantages of FIFO algorithm:
                <ol style="font-size: medium">
                    <li>
                        It is simple and easy to understand & implement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is efficiently used for small systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It does not cause more overhead.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Disadvantages of FIFO algorithm:
                <ol style="font-size: medium">
                    <li>
                        The process effectiveness is low.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When we increase the number of frames while using FIFO, we are giving more memory to processes.
                        So, page fault should decrease, but here the page faults are increasing. This problem is called
                        as Beladyâ€™s Anomaly.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In this algorithm, victim page will be the page which is least recently used.
            </li>
            <li>
                LRU algorithm is a stack-based algorithm because for LRU replacement, the set of pages in memory would
                be the n most recently referenced pages. If the number of frames increases then these n pages will still
                be the most recently referenced and so, will still be in the memory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider the following LRU algorithm example with 5 frames and the page request stream as follows: -
                Number of Page Faults=9.
                Number of Page hits=6.
            </li>
            <img src="./img/6.png" class="m-5 mx-auto" style="width:30%">

                    <li>
                        In this, we replace the page which is least recently used, thus free from Beladyâ€™s Anomaly.

        <h2>Optimal algorithm: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the
                future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimal algorithm is a stack based algorithm because the n frames containing the pages that would not be
                used for the longest duration of time in the future will always by definition be a subset of the n+1
                pages would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future for a particular instant of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider the following optimal algorithm example with four frames and page request stream as shown
                below:
                Number of page faults=5.
                Number of page hits=5.
            </li>

                Advantages of optimal algorithm:
                <ol style="font-size: medium">
                    <li>
                        Complexity is less and easy to implement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assistance needed is low i.e Data Structure used are easy and light.

                Disadvantages of optimal algorithm:
                <ol style="font-size: medium">
                    <li>
                        OPR is perfect, but not possible in practice as the operating system cannot know future
                        requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Error handling is tough.
